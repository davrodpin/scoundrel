# Scoundrel - A Single Player Rogue-like Card Game

This project is a digital implementation of the card game Scoundrel, originally created by Zach Gage and Kurt Bieg. The implementation was done entirely using [Vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding), an AI-powered programming practice where developers can describe their intent in natural language and let AI tools generate the implementation.

## About the Game

Scoundrel is a solitaire card game where you explore a dungeon full of monsters, collecting weapons and potions to survive. The goal is to defeat monsters and survive as long as possible.

### Core Mechanics

- Explore dungeon rooms by flipping cards
- Collect weapons to fight monsters
- Use potions to restore health
- Manage your resources and health carefully
- Decide when to fight and when to flee

To understand all the rules and mechanics of the original game, you can check the [official rules PDF](http://www.stfj.net/art/2011/Scoundrel.pdf).
