# Scoundrel - A Single Player Rogue-like Card Game

This project is a digital implementation of the card game Scoundrel, originally created by Zach Gage and Kurt Bieg. The implementation was done entirely using [Vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding), an AI-powered programming practice where developers can describe their intent in natural language and let AI tools generate the implementation.

## About the Game

Scoundrel is a solitaire card game where you explore a dungeon full of monsters, collecting weapons and potions to survive. The goal is to defeat monsters and survive as long as possible.

To understand all the rules and mechanics of the original game, you can check the [official rules PDF](http://www.stfj.net/art/2011/Scoundrel.pdf).

## Vibe Coding

This project was developed using Vibe coding, a natural and efficient way of programming through voice input and AI assistance. All files in this project were created and edited exclusively through AI assistance, with no manual coding involved. The following tools were used:

- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) - AI-powered code editor that serves as the IDE and AI agent, providing intelligent code completion and natural language processing capabilities
- [WhisperTyping](https://whispertyping.com/) - Speech-to-text software that enables voice dictation, powered by OpenAI's Whisper model for accurate transcription

## Technologies Used

All technologies in this project were selected by the AI agent during the development process:

- React + TypeScript
- Vite for build and development
- Material-UI for components
- State management with React Hooks

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the project with `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5173`
